Abstract: The Clinic Management System is a comprehensive, console-based Java application designed to streamline healthcare workflows and improve patient-doctor interactions. The system automates core administrative processes, including patient registration, doctor scheduling, and multi-slot appointment booking with built-in clash detection. A key feature of the software is its integrated medical prescription module, which cross-references drug components using a data interaction checker to warn clinicians of potential adverse drug events. Furthermore, the application features an automated persistent storage engine that saves records dynamically across custom text files (doctors.txt, patients.txt, appointments.txt, and prescriptions.txt) within a secure folder structure. To optimize operational workflows, the program also provides advanced diagnostic tools that calculate doctor utilization percentages and track peak patient visitation hours recursively, providing clinics with data-driven insights to manage administrative workloads efficiently.
